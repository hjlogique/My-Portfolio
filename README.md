This is my website, logique.com. It has three webpages: About Me, Portfolio and Contact. All three
webppages have the same main header (banner) and footer. The main header includes my name as the 
logo of the website at the top left, and the horizontal navigation buttons at the top right. The 
footer includes the copy right for my website. The About webpage is the website's main page. In 
the main content section, the heading reads "About Me". Below the heading there is a picture of me 
on the left and a paragraph about my work experiences, academic backgrounds and interests on the 
right. The heading of the Portfolio webpage reads "Portfolio". In the main content section, there 
are six images of my artworks displayed in rows and columns. The heading in the Contact webpage 
reads "Contact". In the main content section section, there is a form with three entry fields: 
Name, Email and Message, and a Submit button.

    - Created a CSS for the responsiveness of the website for different devices
      (The provided images of the layouts were used to create the CSS styles).
